## Homework №1
Your task is to develop a simple dictionary from English to Russian. Briefly, you have ENRUS.TXT, there are English words and their Russian equivalents. A program should scan a word from console and print its translation until user enters "0". 


  Example:
  
  accountancy - > учет;
  
  humanize - > очеловечивать;
  
  strangeways - > странно;
  
  
You're welcome to add any additional functuanality, GUI and so on. Good luck =)
