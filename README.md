## Homework №1
Your task is to develop a simple dictionary from English to Russian. Briefly, you have ENRUS.TXT, there are English words and their Russian equivalents. A program should scan a word from console and print its translation until user enters "0". 


  Example:
  
  accountancy - > учет;
  
  humanize - > очеловечивать;
  
  strangeways - > странно;
  
  
You're welcome to add any additional functuanality, GUI and so on. Good luck =) 

## Homework №2
Are you ready to develop Android apps? It doesn't matter, cuz the first homework was just a ROFL =), but the second task's likely to be more complicated for you. Thus, you should develop Finger Fighting App. If your app is so amazing, we'll upload it to the Google Play. The main sense of the idea I'll tell you in a week. Have a nice day! =)
